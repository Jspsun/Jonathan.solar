#Jonathan.Solar - My Personal website

#[Seeing it speaks better than any readme can explain: Jonathan.Solar](http://jonathan.solar/)

Jonathan.Solar started from a stupid joke about my name and eventually became my full-blown personal site. I'm using it to show off some of my technical-talents as well as a way for people to get to know more about me and check out some of my work :)
